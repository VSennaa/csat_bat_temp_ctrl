# Cubesat Battery Temperature Controll
## 🚀 About
Simple temperature controll system, that use lm335z as temp sensor and a peltier to heat the bat module. 
## 📝 How to Use

```shell
# 1. Import the notebook (ipynb) into your environment

# 2. Load your dataset (CSV format), ensuring that the data normalization process is done for numerical features

# 3. Define the prediction input as a dictionary (the data for prediction should be in a similar format to the dataset)

# 4. Run the model prediction (using the trained models: Dummy, Decision Tree, or KNN). The model will predict based on the new data, and you can check the results
